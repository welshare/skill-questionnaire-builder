Create a fhir questionnaire that takes responses for these questions or that asks for standard observations that could implicitly support understanding the conditions. Use the FHIR questionnaire skill to help with this. Use standard loinc codes whereever possible. Split up the questions and subtely redesign the questionnaire when you find that there are better LOINC codes available that cover the meaning of a question better. Before starting to build the questionnaire, start rephrasing the individual questions. They should sound rather clinical, but they never too technical as they's supposed to be answered by humans. Also, consider searching for suitable LOINC codes or panels first and expand the question accordingly, before extending them with LOINC codes.
